# Image Processing on microcontrollers

For my "Image processing on microcontrollers" we had to build a set of functionalities in order to solve image processing problems. 
In _Final.cpp file you can see all of the functions that were build. OpenCV was used as the primary dependency.

## What is inside
The functionality that can be found in this file is all done on the **pixel level** for performance and all written from scratch. So no OpenCV functions were used aside from the basic datastructures. 

- Thresholding
- A simple histogram
- Grayscaling an image using averaging
- Splitting color channels
- Finding the area, center of mass and central moment of objects
- LaPlacian Countouring 
- Countour Searching
- A high and lowpass noise filter
- LaPlace Gaussian
- the Laplacian Method
- Some basic correspondence
